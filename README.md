# To-Do List Web App

This was a project that I worked on as a sophomore in college! ðŸŽ‰

## About the Project

This To-Do List app was a foundational project in my journey to learn and build the basics of frontend development. It helped me understand the fundamentals of:

- HTML for structuring content
- CSS for designing and styling web pages
- JavaScript for adding interactivity and functionality

## Features

- Add new tasks to your to-do list
- Mark tasks as complete
- Remove tasks once they're done
- A clean and minimal design for simplicity

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- Creating a responsive UI
- Managing dynamic content with JavaScript
- Connecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build functional features

## Future Improvements

This is a simple beginner project, but in the future, I might add:

- Saving tasks to local storage
- Categorizing tasks into different lists
- Adding due dates and reminders

This project was a stepping stone in my journey to become a frontend developer, and I'm excited to keep learning and building more complex applications. ðŸ˜Š
